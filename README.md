###### Author: Ryan S. Chung

## Overview

This project analyzes a data set containing information on airbnb rentals in NYC in order to determine which statistical model would be of best fit for a real estate agency to use in predicting the selling price of their own listed rentals.

## Data Used

The data set used in this project was pulled from Kaggle and it represents airbnb rentals from NYC for the year of 2019.  The data set contains various features of airbnb rentals such as neighbourhood, review count, number of reviews, etc.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis and statistical modeling in order to predict the selling price of an airbnb rental based on the features provided in the data set.  The models created for this project included a multiple linear regression model, a K Nearest Neighbors model, a Decision Tree Regressor, a Random Forest Regressor, a XGBoost Regressor, and a Deep Neural Network.

## Conclusions

With the provided data, the model with the lowest Mean Squared Error was the Random Forest Regressor Model.  The model with the second lowest Mean Squared Error was the XGBoost Regressor.
